#Reflections

This project is still ongoing. 
It's my attempt to learn creating both frontend and backend, and connecting them.

On frontend I'm using React with Material UI, and on backend express to create a RESTful api. 
I'm also planning to add a database.

The finished product aim's to be a stoic reflections journal, where the user can save their TODO's. gratitude and reflective journaling. 
The saved journaling items would be saved on a local database, which is connected to a local running API.
User would be able to favorite, edit and delete journal items.
